# capstone-project

I have a file called modeling which has the modeling code set up. Currently there is a pipeline for Random Forest and XGBoost. 

Once I have the data ready I will run the pipelines, find best hyper parameters, and see which model performs better.

Currently working to finalize my datasets.
